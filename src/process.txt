Problem 1

How can we print the board to a console?



One idea is to simply print the 2d grid of characters.

  ABCD
  EFGH
  IJKL
  MNO 

This solution is simple and could be nice for playing on smaller consoles.



A slightly nicer looking interface would include a grid made of - and | chars.

  ---------
  |A|B|C|D|
  ---------
  |E|F|G|H|
  ---------
  |I|J|K|L|
  ---------
  |M|N|O| |
  ---------
  
This is a slightly more complex idea, but could help the user identify the
spacer tile when on the edge of the board. It also looks nicer.

For now let's create an array to hold the chars representing the tiles and a
function to print it to the screen.
